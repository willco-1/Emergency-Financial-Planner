# Emergency-Financial-Planner

Module 5 challenge for the Columbia Engineering Fintech bootcamp.

This project uses the Alpaca Api to pull stock, bond, and crypto data for use in a financial planner application.

The application runs a monte carlo simulation on the data to predict 10 year and 30 year returns of the stock and bond portion of the portfolio.
The data is anaylzed in the jupityer notebook file.
